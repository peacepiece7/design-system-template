# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```

## syncpack

모노레포에서 일관된 종속성 버전을 관리하기 위한 도구이다.

[npm 공식 사이트 참고](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syncpack)

### 설치 및 설정

`pnpm install syncpack --save-dev --workspace-root`

`npm install -g syncpack`

.syncpackrc.cjs 파일을 프로젝트 루트에 생성 후 아래와 같이 설정한다.

```js
module.exports = {
  dependencyTypes: ["dev", "peer", "prod"],
  semverRange: "^",
  source: ["package.json", "apps/*/package.json", "packages/*/package.json"],
  versionGroups: [
    {
      label: 'Internal config packages should be pinned to "*" (meaning any version is acceptable)',
      packages: ["**"],
      dependencies: ["config-prettier", "config-tsconfig", "eslint-config-tds"],
      dependencyTypes: ["dev"],
      pinVersion: "*",
    },
  ],
};
```
